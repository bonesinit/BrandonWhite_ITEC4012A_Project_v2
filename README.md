# BrandonWhite_ITEC4012A_Project_v2

## Notes
<p>Thank you so much for giving us the grace days system for this class! It’s been a busy month (I have a job and I’m finishing my education part time) and because of the three grace days I used, I was able to complete the backend to the best of my ability instead of submitting it totally unfinished.</p>

### Known Issues
<ol>
  <li>I could not get <strong>User Registration</strong> working.</li>

  
  Need to refill all fields for level up, or they get set to defaults
  Can’t get perks to update
  Perks display weirdly on character sheet
  On success, a post goes to success screen, I couldn’t get json working.
</ol>

## Setup

## Test Accounts
<p>I have created a test account for you to use to try out the application. I have pre-created a character associated to this test account, but you can also make more.</p>

<p><strong>Username:</strong> test_user<br>
<strong>Password:</strong> ITEC4012A</p>
